Our project 2 is a shopping list app, where users can log in and create a list of food items to take shopping with them. They will be able to check those items off their list as they shop, and then remove them from their list. If an item is not on the list of items, it can be added. The list of items is communal, meaning that other shoppers can add an item to the items list for everyone to use. The items on an individual shopping list, however, are unique to each individual shopper.

The program is built on a SQL database using a Sequelize ORM and a Node.js and Express web server to serve the information from the database.
